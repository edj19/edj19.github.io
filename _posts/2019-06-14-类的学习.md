# C++ 类(Class)的学习（一）

## 1 基础学习

### 1.1 Define Classes and Declaring Objects

```c++
class ClassName
{
    Access specifier;  //can be private,public or protected
    Data members;      //Variable to be used
    Member Functions(){} //Methods to access data members
};                       //Class name ends with a semicolon
```

**Declaring Objects**

```c++
ClassName ObjectName;
```

**Accessing Data Members**

3 types of access modifiers in c++:

* Public
* Private
* Protected

**Note:**default the access modifier for the members will be **<font color=blue>Private</font>**

* public: All the class members declared under public will be available to everyone

```c++
// C++ program to demonstrate public 
// access modifier 

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

// class definition 
class Circle 
{ 
	public: 
		double radius; 
		
		double compute_area() 
		{ 
			return 3.14*radius*radius; 
		} 
	
}; 

// main function 
int main() 
{ 
	Circle obj; 
	
	// accessing public datamember outside class 
	obj.radius = 5.5; 
	
	cout << "Radius is:" << obj.radius << "\n"; 
	cout << "Area is:" << obj.compute_area(); 
	return 0; 
} 

```



* Private: The class member declared as private can be accessed only by the functions inside the class.They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class. Only the member functions or the <font color=green>friend function</font> are allowed to access the private date member of a class.

```c++
// C++ program to demonstrate private 
// access modifier 

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 

class Circle 
{ 
	// private data member 
	private: 
		double radius; 
	
	// public member function	 
	public:	 
		void compute_area(double r) 
		{ // member function can access private 
			// data member radius 
			radius = r; 
			
			double area = 3.14*radius*radius; 
			
			cout << "Radius is:" << radius << endl; 
			cout << "Area is: " << area; 
		} 
	
}; 

// main function 
int main() 
{ 
	// creating object of the class 
	Circle obj; 
	
	// trying to access private data member 
	// directly outside the class 
	obj.compute_area(1.5); 
	
	
	return 0; 
} 

```

* Protected:Protected access modifier is similar to that of private access modifiers,the difference is that the class member declared as Protected are inaccessible outside the class but they can be accessed by any subclass(derived class) of that class.

```c++
// C++ program to demonstrate private 
// access modifier 

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std; 
/*
class Circle 
{ 
	// private data member 
	private: 
		double radius; 
	
	// public member function	 
	public:	 
		void compute_area(double r) 
		{ // member function can access private 
			// data member radius 
			radius = r;
			double area = 2.14*radius*radius;
			cout<<"Radius is: "<<radius<<endl;
			cout<<"Area is: "<<area<<endl;
		} 
	
}; 
*/

//base class
class Parent
{
	//protected data members
protected:
	int id_protected;
public:
	void display(int id)
	{
		id_protected = id;
		cout<<"Parent id is:"<<id_protected<<endl;
	}
};

//sub class or derived class
class Child: public Parent
{
public:
	void setId(int id)
	{
		// Child class is able to access the inherited
		// protected data member of base class
		id_protected = id;
	}
	void displayId()
	{
		cout<<"id_protected is:"<<id_protected<<endl;
	}
};
// main function 
int main() 
{ 
	// creating object of the class 
	Parent obj;
	Child obj1; 
	
	// member function of the derived class can
	//access the protected data members of base class
	obj.display(15);
	obj1.setId(81);
	obj1.displayId(); 
	return 0; 
} 

```



```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Geeks
{
	//Access specifier
public:
	//Data Members
	string geekname;
	//Member Functions()
	void printname()
	{
		cout<<"Geekname is: "<<geekname<<'\n';
	}
};

int main(){
	//Declare an object of class geeks
	Geeks obj1;
	//Accessing data member
	obj1.geekname = "Abhi";

	//Accessing member function
	obj1.printname();
	return 0;
}c
```

**Member Functions in Classes**

There are 2 ways to define a member function:

* Inside class definition
* Outside class definition

To define a member function outside the class definition we have to use the scope resolution ::

operator along with class name and function name.

```c++
// C++ program to demonstrate function 
// declaration outside class 

#include <iostream> 
#include<string>
using namespace std; 
class Geeks 
{ 
	public: 
	string geekname; 
	int id; 
	
	// printname is not defined inside class defination 
	void printname(); 
	
	// printid is defined inside class defination 
	void printid() 
	{ 
		cout << "Geek id is: " << id; 
	} 
}; 

// Definition of printname using scope resolution operator :: 
void Geeks::printname() 
{ 
	cout << "Geekname is: " << geekname; 
} 
int main() { 
	
	Geeks obj1; 
	obj1.geekname = "xyz"; 
	obj1.id=15; 
	
	// call printname() 
	obj1.printname(); 
	cout << endl; 
	
	// call printid() 
	obj1.printid(); 
	return 0; 
} 

```

**Note:**Declaring a **<font color=green>friend function</font>** is a way to give private access to a non-member function.

<font color=blue size=4.5>Friend class and function in C++</font>

**Friend Class** A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class.For example a Linked List class may be allowed to access private members of Node.

```c++
class Node 
{ 
private: 
int key; 
Node *next; 
/* Other members of Node Class */

friend class LinkedList; // Now class LinkedList can 
						// access private members of Node 
}; 

```

**Friend Function** Like friend class, a friend function can be given special grant to access private and protected members. A friend function can be:

a) A method of another class

b) A global function

```c++
class Node 
{ 
private: 
int key; 
Node *next; 

/* Other members of Node Class */
friend int LinkedList::search(); // Only search() of linkedList 
								// can access internal members 
}; 

```

Some important points about friend functions and classes:

1. Friends should be used only for lmited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens（减轻）the value of encapsulation（封装，包装） of separate classes in object-oriented programming.
2. Friendship is not mutual. If a class A is friend of B,then B doesn't become friend of A automatically.
3. Friendship is not inherited（继承）
4. The concept of friends is not there in Java



**A simple and complete C++ program to demonstrate friend Class**

```c++
#include <iostream> 
class A { 
private: 
	int a; 
public: 
	A() { a=0; } 
	friend class B;	 // Friend Class 
}; 

class B { 
private: 
	int b; 
public: 
	void showA(A& x) { 
		// Since B is friend of A, it can access 
		// private members of A 
		std::cout << "A::a=" << x.a; 
	} 
}; 

int main() { 
A a; 
B b; 
b.showA(a); 
return 0; 
} 

```



```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Foo; // Forward declaration of class Foo in order for example to compile.
class Bar {
  private:
      int a;
  public:
      Bar(): a(0) {}
      void show(Bar& x, Foo& y);
      friend void show(Bar& x, Foo& y); // declaration of global friend
};
 
class Foo {
  private:
      int b;
  public: 
      Foo(): b(6) {}
      friend void show(Bar& x, Foo& y); // declaration of global friend
      friend void Bar::show(Bar& x, Foo& y); // declaration of friend from other class 
};
 
// Definition of a member function of Bar; this member is a friend of Foo
void Bar::show(Bar& x, Foo& y) {
  cout << "Show via function member of Bar" << endl;
  cout << "Bar::a = " << x.a << endl;
  cout << "Foo::b = " << y.b << endl;
}
 
// Friend for Bar and Foo, definition of global function
void show(Bar& x, Foo& y) {
  cout << "Show via global function" << endl;
  cout << "Bar::a = " << x.a << endl;
  cout << "Foo::b = " << y.b << endl;
}
 
int main() {
   Bar a;
   Foo b;
 
   show(a,b);
   a.show(a,b);
}
```
